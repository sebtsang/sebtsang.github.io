								<h3><u>Introduction</u></h3>
								<p>Hey! I'm Sebastian, a third-year Computer Science Co-op student at the University of Guelph. This term, I had the opportunity to complete my first co-op placement as an IT Operations Intern at Interac.</p>
								<p>During my time here, I contributed to impactful reporting and automation projects and honed both my technical and professional skills. In this report, I’ll reflect on my time at Interac, the goals I set, and how this opportunity has shaped my development and the trajectory of my career.</p>

								<h3><u>About the Company</u></h3>
								<p>Interac is a leading Canadian provider of payment solutions, known well for their services like Interac Debit and Interac e-Transfer. Since 1984, they helped millions of Canadians make secure and fast transactions every day. In 2023, Canadians completed over 6.5 billion Debit transactions, and 88% of Canadians managed their funds using e-Transfer. The company continues to innovate with new products like Interac Verified and Konek. I had the opportunity to work at their Head Office located at 200 Bay Street in Toronto.</p>
								<p>Fun fact: Only 30 interns were selected from a pool of over 14,000 applicants, highlighting the talent and impact of the team at Interac.</p>

								<p><strong>I had the opportunity to attend the Elevate Festival 2024</strong></p>

								<h3><u>About My Role</u></h3>
								<p>As an IT Operations Intern on the IT Operations team, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of impactful projects, with a primary focus on automation and reporting. One of my key responsibilities was automating the previously manual Debit & e-Transfer Customer Journey Success (CJS) reports, which are essential for tracking performance and identifying areas for improvement. This project involved transforming manual processes into dynamic, automated workflows and creating high-level visualizations in Tableau, significantly reducing manual effort and increasing reporting accuracy.</p>
								<p>A major area of focus within the IT Operations team was Enterprise Incident Management (EIM), which is responsible for resolving customer-impacting incidents across all Interac products. I assisted in troubleshooting and resolving lower-severity tickets, particularly those related to transactional data files from clients and vendors. These files are crucial for determining Interac's monthly revenue, and any missing or incomplete data can cause significant disruptions. I played an active role in ensuring that these issues were resolved swiftly, helping maintain the accuracy of billing and ensuring timely payments.</p>
								<p>The skills I applied were a mix of classroom knowledge and on-the-job learning. My coursework taught me valuable problem-solving techniques, which I was able to apply in my role. A key skill I developed on the job was collaboration. I learned to work more effectively with diverse teams, ensuring smooth communication and fostering a unified approach to resolving issues and completing projects.</p>

								<h3><u>Learning Goals</u></h3>
								<p>At the start of my co-op term, I set three primary goals:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Technological Literacy: Improve basic proficiency in Splunk</li>
									<li>Professional & Ethical Behaviour: Strengthen communication and collaboration skills with team members</li>
									<li>Critical & Creative Thinking: Enhance problem-solving and critical thinking abilities</li>
								</ol>
								<p>These goals aligned with my role and areas I wanted to develop to contribute to my team and grow professionally.</p>
								<ol>
									<li><strong>Technological Literacy:</strong><br>
									Before this term, I had limited experience with Splunk and by dedicating time to hands-on practice and applying Splunk in key projects, like the e-Transfer Customer Journey Success (CJS) automation project, I significantly improved my proficiency. Successfully implementing Splunk for automation not only met my learning goals but also contributed directly to team success.</li>

									<li><strong>Professional & Ethical Behaviour:</strong><br>
									My efforts to enhance communication and collaboration paid off as I actively participated in meetings, sought feedback, and clearly communicated technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders. These actions resulted in improved workflow efficiency and positive feedback from team members, as demonstrated by a survey I conducted. The survey rated my skills out of 5, with the results reflecting the rounded average of all submissions:
									<ul>
										<li>Works well with others and promotes teamwork: 4/5</li>
										<li>Communicates openly and honestly, ensuring transparency and trust within the team: 5/5</li>
										<li>Demonstrates openness to feedback and actively learns from others to improve: 5/5</li>
										<li>Demonstrates clear reasoning and justification for decisions made: 4/5</li>
									</ul>
									</li>

									<li><strong>Critical & Creative Thinking:</strong><br>
									Tackling complex automation challenges allowed me to refine my problem-solving skills. I identified inefficiencies in existing processes, proposed solutions, and implemented improvements independently, showcasing initiative and strategic thinking. One example was when I addressed Splunk Alert failures within the CJS automation by designing a validation process without prompting, demonstrating my ability to go above and beyond.</li>
								</ol>
								<p>I'm very proud of the progress I made on all three goals. Each one provided valuable learning experiences and allowed me to make meaningful contributions to my team. While I continue striving for growth, the skills and knowledge I gained have strengthened both my technical expertise and professional development.</p>

								<h3><u>Conclusion</u></h3>
								<p>My co-op term at Interac has been a transformative experience, providing me with valuable opportunities to grow both technically and professionally. Through impactful automation projects and my involvement in EIM, I was able to contribute to Interac’s success while developing a deeper understanding of how technology drives operational excellence within an organization.</p>
								<p>This placement pushed me to refine my problem-solving abilities, enhance my communication skills, and build collaborative relationships with diverse teams. I learned the importance of adaptability and proactive thinking, which proved essential in implementing automations and resolving incidents. Each obstacle became an opportunity to grow and deliver solutions that had a tangible impact on my team and the company.</p>
								<p>Looking back, I’m proud to say that the goals I set at the beginning of the term were not only met but exceeded. I leave this experience with a clearer sense of direction for my career and a newfound confidence in my ability to take on complex challenges. My time at Interac has shaped my development and given me a clearer vision of the direction I want to pursue.</p>
								<p>I’m incredibly grateful for the support of my team, who provided guidance, mentorship, and encouragement throughout this journey. The chance to contribute to a company that plays such a pivotal role in Canada’s financial ecosystem has been both humbling and inspiring. As I move forward, I carry with me the skills, knowledge, and confidence I gained during this incredible journey.</p>
