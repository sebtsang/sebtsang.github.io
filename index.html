								<h3><u>About My Role</u></h3>
								<p>As an IT Operations Intern on the IT Operations team, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of impactful projects, with a primary focus on automation and reporting. One of my key responsibilities was automating the previously manual Debit & e-Transfer Customer Journey Success (CJS) reports, which are essential for tracking performance and identifying areas for improvement. This project involved transforming manual processes into dynamic, automated workflows and creating high-level visualizations in Tableau, significantly reducing manual effort and increasing reporting accuracy.</p>
								<p>A major area of focus within the IT Operations team was Enterprise Incident Management (EIM), which is responsible for resolving customer-impacting incidents across all Interac products. I assisted in troubleshooting and resolving lower-severity tickets, particularly those related to transactional data files from clients and vendors. These files are crucial for determining Interac's monthly revenue, and any missing or incomplete data can cause significant disruptions. I played an active role in ensuring that these issues were resolved swiftly, helping maintain the accuracy of billing and ensuring timely payments.</p>
								<p>The skills I applied were a mix of classroom knowledge and on-the-job learning. My coursework taught me valuable problem-solving techniques, which I was able to apply in my role.

								<li>Technological Literacy – Automation: Build automation tools to reduce repetitive tasks and improve efficiency</li>
								<li>Technological Literacy – QA/Dev Practices: Implement automated quality checks into the CI/CD workflow</li>
								</ol>
								<p>These goals aligned closely with my role and areas I wanted to develop to both contribute to my team and grow professionally. Each one gave me a concrete way to measure my progress and ensure that my work was meaningful to both myself and the organization.</p>

								<ol>
								<li><strong>Information Literacy:</strong><br>
								At the beginning of the term, I wanted to develop a stronger grasp of how the Data Engineering team functioned within Interac. I committed to actively participating in standups, sprint planning, and 1:1s with my team lead to gain a deeper understanding of our systems and priorities. Over time, I became more confident in navigating team processes and speaking to the work being done. By the midpoint of the term, I was able to summarize sprint outcomes, contribute to discussions on reporting metrics, and ask questions that demonstrated my growing knowledge of team workflows. This growth allowed me to integrate more seamlessly into the team and provided a foundation for taking on more complex technical tasks.</li>

								<li><strong>Technological Literacy – Automation:</strong><br>
								One of my key objectives was to build automation that reduced manual effort for recurring sprint work. I accomplished this by creating a Python-based toolkit that handled repetitive Jira tasks such as generating peer review tickets, creating recurring sprint assignments, and uploading reports directly to Confluence. These automations were quickly adopted by the team and proved especially valuable during sprint planning and retrospectives. By eliminating repetitive manual tasks, I enabled the team to save time and focus on higher-value engineering work. This project also gave me hands-on experience in designing CLI-based workflows, error handling, and Jira API integration—skills that extended far beyond my initial expectations for this goal.</li>

								<li><strong>Technological Literacy – QA/Dev Practices:</strong><br>
								A major goal for me this term was to contribute to improving our development pipeline by incorporating automated quality checks. I successfully designed and deployed a full SonarQube integration with our GitHub repository and CI/CD workflow. This integration ensured that every commit and pull request was automatically analyzed for vulnerabilities, bugs, and code smells, embedding quality checks directly into our development process. Rolling out this integration was a milestone achievement, as it not only reduced the burden of manual code review but also established a sustainable framework for enforcing engineering standards across the team. By documenting and sharing the workflow, I ensured that others could build upon and extend this integration in the future.</li>
								</ol>
